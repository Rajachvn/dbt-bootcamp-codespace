    description: The fct_reviews model is a transformation of the raw_reviews table
      from the AIRBNB schema. It includes the listing_id, review_date,
      reviewer_name, review_text, and review_sentiment columns. The model also
      generates a unique review_id for each record by concatenating and hashing
      the listing_id, review_date, reviewer_name, and review_text. The model
      filters out any records where the review_text is null.

        data_type: varchar
    description: The 'mart_fullmoon_reviews' model is a transformation of the
      'fct_reviews' table from the 'AIRBNB.DEV' schema. It includes all columns
      from the 'fct_reviews' table and adds a new column 'is_full_moon'. This
      column is determined by joining the 'fct_reviews' table with the
      'seed_full_moon_dates' table, also from the 'AIRBNB.DEV' schema. If the
      review date is one day after a full moon date, the 'is_full_moon' column
      is set to 'full moon', otherwise it is set to 'not full moon'.
